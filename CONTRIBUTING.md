# Contributing to Anomaly-Detection-IIoT

This project was developed as part of academic research on federated anomaly detection in IIoT settings.

## Scope

While this repository is not actively maintained for collaborative development, contributions that improve clarity, fix reproducible issues, or extend functionality in line with the project's architecture are welcome.

## Contributing Guidelines

- Open an issue first if you're planning to suggest significant changes or enhancements.
- Focus on clean, well-documented code (PEP8, concise comments, and docstrings where needed).
- If adding functionality: keep modularity and resource constraints in mind (the code targets distributed, low-power clients).
- For small fixes (typos, doc updates, reproducible bugs), feel free to open a pull request directly.

## Setup & Reproducibility

See the `README.md` for setup instructions and evaluation procedures. If anything is unclear, please open an issue.
